# TechLabPracticals
Welcome to the TechLabPracticals repository! Here, you'll find practical exercises completed during my computer engineering program, covering various subjects across several semesters. Each exercise undergoes thorough review and continuous improvement based on feedback from instructors and peers. Contributions and collaborations are encouraged to enrich the repository with practical knowledge in software engineering, data structures, networking, operating systems, and more. Thank you for exploring and contributing to this repository, documenting my journey through computer engineering studies.
